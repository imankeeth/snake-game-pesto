## Instructions
- [ ] You have to create a **Snake Game** using [`React`](https://reactjs.org/).
- [ ] If you don't know the mechanics of the game, here's a [link](https://playsnake.org/). Remember, your game doesn't have to be a copy of this. Only the mechanics are important.
- [ ] The game should be playable using the 4 arrow keys.
- [ ] The game should be able to display a score.
- [ ] You have to make a github repository under your profile and push there all the code.
- [ ] The game should be deployed on a static web hosting site such as `github.io` or `netlify.com`.
- [ ] In the beginning, don't focus on the animation/graphics a lot.

## Optional Features
- [ ] Make the user sign-in and allow keeping of personal high-scores.
- [ ] Make a leader board displaying highest scores of all times along with username.
- [ ] Make multiple levels of the games such that after crossing one level, the speed of the snake increases by some factor.
- [ ] Allow for **rewards** which provide extra bonuses, shortening of snake length, etc.
- [ ] Think of some other additions that you can make to this classic game.
- [ ] Write unit tests/integration tests for the game.
